## Description
This project is a dashboard for managing restaurants. You can organize all of your recived orders, your month reveneu and even your canceled order, and easily see metrics in nice charts <br/>

## Technologies
- React
  - React is the main library that I used to build the interface.
- Tailwind CSS
  - Tailwind CSS is my choice for the styling of this project.
- Shadcn-ui
  - I used shadcn-ui to accelerate the development of common components  
- MSW
  - MSW was used to mock all API request
- Vitest
  - Vitest was used integrated with testing-library to write all unitary tests in the appication 
- PlayWright
  - PlayWright is the library I used to create all end to end tests for the application   

## How to execute the project

- Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HaloSara121/halo-pizzashop.git

- Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
 
- Run the project: 
   ```bash

- // Execute the test script so that you don't need to clone the API project from Rocketseat.<br/>
  // the login page on test mode will only pass using "johndoe@example.com" as your email. <br/>
  // the resgistration of a new restaurant will only pass with de name Pizza Shop. <br/>
